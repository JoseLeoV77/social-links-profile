## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the adress, q and blockquote elements, i ended up using just the adress element in the end though. 
I have to admit, i'm not 100% sure this is the correct way to do it, so if anybody sees this, please tell me how to correctly use it in this context, or if it's even need it. 

```html
<address class="profile-info">
  <h2 class="profile-name">Jessica Randall</h2>
  <span class="profile-location">London, United Kingdom</span>
</address>
```

### Continued development

I'm still refining CSS and HTML

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) - it's always useful to see the different HTML elements. I also use it with CSS
